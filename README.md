# Eyes
## [Exercise on eyes](https://vimmit.github.io/Eye-exercise/)

The eyes follow the movement of the mouse. Eye and the eye balls are made using CSS. I get the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer whenever the mouse moves and
divide it by window's width and height respectively and get percentage of it. Then I set the top and left properties of each ball to corresponding Y and X.

How to Run: Move your mouse around the screen and the eye balls will follow your mouse pointer.

Roadmap of future improvements: I would add more features to make it look like a face such as mouth, nose, eyebrows and the boundary of the face.
